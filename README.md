 **PuffBot** :
 PuffBot is a lightweight FAQ chatbot built using:
 1. Python
 2. Flask
 3. TF-IDF vectorization.  
It is designed to answer frequently asked questions with accuracy and display a user-friendly chat interface where:
- User messages appear on the **right**.
- Bot responses appear on the **left**.
- Answers are matched using **cosine similarity** on the FAQ dataset.
PuffBot can easily be extended by adding more FAQs to the dataset.
